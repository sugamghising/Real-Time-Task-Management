# Real-Time Task Management Board

This repository contains a **real‑time task management board** built with a Node/Express backend and a modern frontend (Vite/React). The backend is written in TypeScript and uses ES‑module syntax.

## Project Structure

- **backend/** – TypeScript Express server
- **frontend/** – Vite‑powered React application
- **.gitignore** – Common ignore patterns for Node/TS projects

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run backend (in development mode)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Run frontend (in another terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Starts the development server for the respective package.
- `npm run build` – Builds the production bundle.
